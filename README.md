## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out an article preview component with JavaScript (and of course, get it looking as close to the design as possible).

### Solution retrospective

This is my initial solution using JavaScript. While I recognize there is much to learn, I took the initiative to develop this solution based on my current knowledge. Additionally, I employed Sass for the second time; although I am gradually mastering its features, I acknowledge that there is still room for improvement in writing cleaner and more efficient code.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
